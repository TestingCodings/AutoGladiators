- **BattleItem**: New consumable system with cooldowns and effects
- **EnhancedBattleViewModel**: Manages complex battle state and turn logic
- **EnhancedInventoryService**: Handles item usage with cooldown tracking

### **Data Flow**
1. Player selects move/item
2. System validates availability (MP, level, cooldowns, uses)
3. If valid, executes action and applies costs
4. Updates UI with animations and feedback
5. Processes turn end (regeneration, cooldowns, status effects)
6. Switches to enemy turn with AI decision making

### **Balance Considerations**
- Basic moves ensure gameplay never stalls
- MP regeneration prevents permanent resource depletion

5. **Strategic Play**: Try to save MP for powerful finishing moves
